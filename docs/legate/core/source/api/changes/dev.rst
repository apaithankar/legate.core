Changes: Latest Development Version
===================================

..
   STYLE:
   * Capitalize sentences.
   * Use the imperative tense: Add, Improve, Change, etc.
   * Use a period (.) at the end of entries.
   * Be concise yet informative.
   * If possible, provide an executive summary of the new feature, but do not just repeat
     its doc string. However, if the feature requires changes from the user, then describe
     those changes in detail, and provide examples of the changes required.
