Changes: 24.05
==============
..
   STYLE:
   * Capitalize sentences.
   * Use the imperative tense: Add, Improve, Change, etc.
   * Use a period (.) at the end of entries.
   * Be concise yet informative.
   * If possible, provide an executive summary of the new feature, but do not just repeat
     its doc string. However, if the feature requires changes from the user, then describe
     those changes in detail, and provide examples of the changes required.


.. rubric:: General:

- Legate ``tester`` now also shows the ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` produced by timed-out
  tests. Previously it silently gobbled these.

.. rubric:: Configuration/Build:

- Enforce minimum CUDA version of 11.8. The build system will now emit a fatal error at
  configure-time if the CUDA toolkit version is below this threshold.
- ``configure`` now allows passing through arbitrary CMake arguments to the underlying
  CMake configuration. Any arguments following a bare ``--`` are forwarded verbatim to
  CMake:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ ./configure --some --configure --arguments -- -DCMAKE_FOO=OFF -DCMAKE_BAR=ON
     # -DCMAKE_FOO=OFF and -DCMAKE_BAR=ON are forwarded as-is to CMake. configure
     # does not process them in any way.

- Add ``--build-type=debug-sanitizer``. This build configuration enables a full debug
  build as well as `AddressSanitizer <https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer>`_,
  `UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer
  <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html>`_, and, if supported,
  `LeakSanitizer <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LeakSanitizer.html>`_.

.. rubric:: Data

- Remove default constructor for ``LogicalArray``, ``LogicalStore``, ``PhysicalArray``,
  ``PhysicalStore``. These were never "valid" methods to construct these objects, and only
  existed to work around deficiencies in the Cython compiler. Users should use the various
  ``Runtime`` methods to construct these objects instead.

.. rubric:: Mapping

.. rubric:: Partitioning

- Remove default constructor for ``Variable``, and ``Constraint``. These were never
  "valid" methods to construct these objects, and only existed to work around deficiencies
  in the Cython compiler. Users should use the various ``Task`` and constraint-generating
  methods (e.g. ``align()``, ``scale()``) to construct these objects instead.

.. rubric:: Tasks

- Remove default constructor for ``AutoTask``, and ``ManualTask``. These were never
  "valid" methods to construct these objects, and only existed to work around deficiencies
  in the Cython compiler. Users should use the various ``Runtime`` methods to construct
  these objects instead.
- Allow declaring default task ``VariantOption``'s per variant inline within the task
  declaration. If present, these default options will be used at task registration. See
  ``LegateTask`` for further discussion.

.. rubric:: Types

.. rubric:: Runtime

- Remove default constructor for ``Library``, and ``Type``. These were never "valid"
  methods to construct these objects, and only existed to work around deficiencies in the
  Cython compiler. Users should use the various ``Runtime`` methods to construct these
  objects instead.
- Add ``Runtime::get_executing_processor()``.

.. rubric:: Utilities

- Rename ``<core/cuda_help.h>`` to ``<core/cuda.h>``. While this header is publicly
  exported, it is only done so out of necessity, and users are encouraged not to rely on
  it.
