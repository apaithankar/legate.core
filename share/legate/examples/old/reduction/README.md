# Reduction examples

This tutorial explains how one can write reduction code in various scenarios.
Specifically, the tutorial contains these three examples:

1. Dimension-wise reductions (sum_over_axis.py, matmul.py)
2. All-reduce reductions (bincount.py, histogram.py)
3. Set reductions (unique.py)
