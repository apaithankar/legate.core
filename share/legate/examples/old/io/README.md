# Legate IO example

This tutorial illustrates how one can build an I/O library in Legate using the
following three scenarios:

1. I/O with a single file (`write_file`, `read_file`, `read_file_parallel`)
2. I/O with a dataset of uneven tiles (`write_uneven_tiles`, `read_uneven_tiles`)
3. I/O with a dataset of even tiles (`write_even_tiles`, `read_even_tiles`)

This tutorial also teaches you how to make a domain library container interoperate
with other libraries via Legate data interface.
