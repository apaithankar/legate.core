    # A little explanation. We want to encourage configuration options be
    # passed via LEGATE_CONFIG, in order to be considerate to user scripts.
    # But we still need to accept actual command line args for comaptibility,
    # and those should also take precedences. Here we splice the options from
    # LEGATE_CONFIG in before sys.argv, and take advantage of the fact that if
    # there are any options repeated in both places, argparse will use the
    # latter (i.e. the actual command line provided ones).
